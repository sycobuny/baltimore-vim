          Standards of Behavior for the Baltimore Vim user group
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Baltimore Vim group is founded around the idea of sharing great
          information and having a good time programming, for everyone who
          wants to learn something knew, or share something awesome they know,
          regardless of gender identity/expression, race, creed, age,
          disability, or any of the other ways which humans are forcibly
          divided.
        </p>

        <p>
          Illegal activities will not be permitted in any capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Harrassment, intimidation, or physical violence will not be
          tolerated. Anyone who violates this standard will immediately be
          asked to leave the group. Derogatory/insulting language or behavior,
          especially based on demeaning stereotypes, will merit a warning, and
          multiple offenses will also result in expulsion from the group.
          Particularly egregious violations may result in immediate expulsion
          on first offense.
        </p>

        <p>
          Speakers are expected to adhere to these standards of behavior.
          Content warnings are expected for any talk which might cause stress
          to audience members, and lack of such consideration may cause talks
          to be rejected in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          The meeting space will be treated with care and respect. Property of
          the meeting space must be handled with care, and trash not left
          lying around. Anyone who is seen to be mistreating the space may be
          asked to leave the group.
        </p>

          If you feel as though another member has violated these standards,
          please contact an organizer, either in person or through
          email/Twitter. Your anonymity will be respected unless you give
          permission to use your information in connection with any reports.

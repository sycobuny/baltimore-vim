            Accessibility in Vim - Requested by Stephen Belcher
            <p>
              Accessibility is an important issue in designing systems to
              maximize use for everyone, but the tools we use to design those
              systems are sometimes overlooked. I'm curious whether there has
              been work done to ensure or enable Vim to be used in an
              accessible way, and how this would work in variousc
              accessibility scenarios.

            Emacs for the Vim User - Requested by Stephen Belcher
            <p>
              Emacs is pretty similar to Vim in a lot of important ways, and
              is often seen as a competitor. A few plugins, such as Vim-Slime,
              attempt to mimic functionality therein. But, I've never known
              much beyond that and I'd like to! If there's someone out there
              who knows enough about Emacs and Vim who can share how to get
              the most out of both, I'd love to hear it.

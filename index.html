          We will generally meet on the third Wednesday of the month, from
          6:30-7:30 PM, with a "Social Hour" at a local walking-distance
          venue. Depending on venue and organizer availability, this schedule
          may need to be periodically tweaked, so make sure you're signed up
          with <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Vim">our Meetup
          page</a>, so you can receive notifications (if you want) about our
          schedule. It is also the first page to receive updates when we
          schedule our Meetups, so it's the happening place for piping-hot
          news!

        <p>
          Meetings are organized by Stephen Belcher (@sycobuny on
          <a href="https://github.com/sycobuny">GitHub</a>). Born in
          Massachussetts but raised in Baltimore, Stephen has presented at
          <a href="http://baltimore.pm.org/">local Perl Mongers meetups</a>
          as well as being a regular presenter at the annual
          <a href="http://dcbpw.org/">DC/Baltimore Perl Workshop</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently he works as a contractor at the National Institute on
          Aging in the Biomedical Research Center on the Johns Hopkins Bayview
          campus in East Baltimore, where he writes programs to support
          scientific research.
        </p>

        <p>
          In his spare time he plays his harp, occasionally performing with
          local orchestra and chamber groups, and spends an unhealthy amount
          of time rewatching old episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with
          his husband.

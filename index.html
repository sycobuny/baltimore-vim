        </h3>

        <p>
          Meetings are organized by Stephen Belcher (@sycobuny on
          <a href="https://twitter.com/sycobuny">Twitter</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/sycobuny">GitHub</a>). Born in
          Massachussetts but raised in Baltimore, Stephen has presented at
          <a href="http://baltimore.pm.org/">local Perl Mongers meetups</a>
          as well as being a regular presenter at the annual
          <a href="http://dcbpw.org/">DC/Baltimore Perl Workshop</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently he works as a contractor at the National Institute on
          Aging in the Biomedical Research Center on the Johns Hopkins Bayview
          campus in East Baltimore, where he writes programs to support
          scientific research.
        </p>

        <p>
          In his spare time he plays his harp, occasionally performing with
          local orchestra and chamber groups, and spends an unhealthy amount
          of time rewatching old episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with
          his husband.

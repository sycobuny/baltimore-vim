        <p>
          If you've wanted to stand up and speak your mind, and got yourself
          all the way to our <a href="submit-a-talk.html">talk submission
          page</a>, only to find that you couldn't think of just what to talk
          about, you may be in luck. This page will list various topics that
          members have indicated they'd like to hear about in the future, and
          if it turns out you know anything about them, you've got your seed
          of an idea right there!
        </p>

        <p>
          As the group is fairly new, we haven't received any suggested topics
          yet, but feel free to check back here any time to see if you've got
          something to say and you just don't know it yet!
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, if you have an idea for a talk that you'd like to <b>hear</b>,
          send a tweet my way
          (<a href="https://twitter.com/sycobuny">@sycobuny</a> on Twitter),
          and I'll add it to this page!

          Baltimore Vim Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
        </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Why do you have a link to "ICCF Holland"?
            <p>
              Vim is self-described as "charityware", which means that if you
              want to support its development, they ask that you donate to a
              worthy cause, and ICCF Holland is that cause. It funds both
              health services and schooling for children in need in Uganda.
              There's lots of information on their page, we encourage you to
              check it out!
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            What should I bring to Meetups?
            <p>
              Yourself! You don't need to bring anything, though if you have
              some way to take notes (a notepad will do), that could help you
              remember anything cool you learn. And, if you've got a laptop
              available to try things out, it could be even easier to learn.
              But talks should ideally be given in such a way that all you
              have to do is show up!
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not looking to have snacks at our Meetup, because our
              social hour will be taking place where there's food available,
              but if you have very specific dietary restrictions or allergies,
              you may want to
              <a href="http://www.yumsasianbistro.com/menu.html">check out
              their menu</a> in advance.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Can I help support the group?
            <p>
              For the time being, the group is small enough, and our venue
              accomodating enough, that our expenses are taken care of. If
              you'd like to help support Vim in Baltimore, there are two main
              things you can do:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li><a href="submit-a-talk.html">Give a Talk</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://iccf-holland.org/">Donate to the ICCF
                Holland</a></li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              If you need some help picking out a talk topic, check
              <a href="suggest-a-talk.html">here</a>. If you're worried about
              whether you <i>should</i> give a talk, check below:
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            What qualifications do I need to give a talk?
            <p>
              You need to answer the following question with a "yes": Do you
              want to give a talk?
            </p>
            <p>
              We'd like to hear from anyone who'd like to share some
              knowledge. You don't need to have given any other talks, or have
              any specific certifications or degrees.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Can I only come to the social hour?
            <p>
              Certainly! You don't have to listen to the technical talks if
              that isn't your cup of tea. We make two separate meetups on
              <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Vim/">our Meetup.com
              page</a> just for such an occasion: you can come to the
              technical hour, the social hour, or both! Please do RSVP if you
              intend to come to the social hour, though, we'd like to give the
              resturant a heads-up/make a reservation if the crowd gets big
              enough.

            Who's organizing/sponsoring this Meetup?
            <p>
              Meetings are organized by Stephen Belcher (@sycobuny on
              <a href="https://github.com/sycobuny">GitHub</a>). Born in
              Massachussetts but raised in Baltimore, Stephen has presented at
              <a href="http://baltimore.pm.org/">local Perl Mongers
              meetups</a>
              as well as being a regular presenter at the annual
              <a href="http://dcbpw.org/">DC/Baltimore Perl Workshop</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently he works as a contractor at the National Institute on
              Aging in the Biomedical Research Center on the Johns Hopkins
              Bayview campus in East Baltimore, where he writes programs to
              support scientific research.
            </p>

            <p>
              In his spare time he plays his harp, occasionally performing
              with local orchestra and chamber groups, and spends an unhealthy
              amount of time rewatching old episodes of Mystery Science
              Theater 3000 with his husband.

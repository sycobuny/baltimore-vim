Contributing
============

If you'd like to make a correction or improvement to the site itself, please
fork the repository and submit a pull request. Ideally, you should follow the
style of the site and format your commit messages as suggested by Tim Pope at
http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html, but if
your work is good, I won't be a huge pedant about it.

If you're actually looking to submit a talk, please use the form on the site
itself, at http://baltimorevim.org/submit-a-talk.html.
